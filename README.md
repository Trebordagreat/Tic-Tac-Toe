# Tic-Tac-Toe

The purpose of this project is to construct a playable game of Tic-Tac-Toe on a Web Page.  By doing so, I will get a better understanding of factory functions, scope, the module pattern, and organizing my code.  This project is outlined in the Javascript course on The Odin Project.  I will also use this README as a spot to place pseudocode to help display my thought process throughout the project.  Now onto Step 2.

2. Store the game board as an array inside of a Gameboard object.
- Instructions hint that gameBoard should be a module object
- Players are going to be factory functions as there are multiple
- displayController is going to be a module object

Important to add classes to each cell about different groups they can be in to win.  For example "row 1" "column 2" and if they all have the same textContent, then a win condition has been met.
